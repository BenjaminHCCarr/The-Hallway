## Welcome to HPC Hallway

As follow-up of the weekly #HPCHuddles started by Andrew Jones [@hpcnotes](https://twitter.com/hpcnotes).
A place for informal discussions around HPC, AI, Cloud, and related topics.

## We will have daily huddles throughout SC20 at 1pm Atlanta time!

The daily huddles will run from 16th to 19th November from 1pm to 2pm Atlanta time at [this link](https://aka.ms/hpc_hallway).
Come and join the conversation - live during the #HPCHuddles or find link collections through our slack channel.

The huddle has some simple rules: (1) be kind to each other, and (2) give everybody a chance to speak.
