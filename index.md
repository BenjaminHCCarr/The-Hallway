## Welcome to HPC Hallway

Weekly virtual huddles for informal, open discussions around HPC, AI, Cloud, and related topics started by Andrew Jones (follow him on twitter @hpcnotes).

We now maintain a Slack for follow-up discussions or chatting during conferences and alike.

You can join the Slack using http://tiny.cc/join-hpc-huddle-slack
