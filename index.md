## Welcome to HPC Hallway

As follow-up of the weekly #HPCHuddles started by Andrew Jones [@hpcnotes](https://twitter.com/hpcnotes).
A place for informal discussions around HPC, AI, Cloud, and related topics.

## HPC Huddle

The HPC huddle is an open, informal weekly meeting of people using [this link](https://aka.ms/hpc_hallway).
Come and join the conversation - live during the #HPCHuddles or find link collections through our slack channel.
The huddle has some simple rules: (1) be kind to each other, and (2) give everybody a chance to speak.

We now have agreed on a schedule the huddle follows.
To make participation possible to as many people as possible, it does change the day of the week and the time of the day.
